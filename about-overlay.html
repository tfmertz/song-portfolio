  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>Hi, I'm Tom Mertz! This is my electronic song portfolio and also one of my web design projects. All of the songs are various tunes I have created in Pro Tools, REAPER, and FL Studio. The website was created using HTML, CSS, and the layout is totally responsive between different mobile browser and desktop browser sizes.</p>
